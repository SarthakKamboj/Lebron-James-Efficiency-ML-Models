<p>
    Lebron James is one of the best players in the NBA and the star player of the Los Angeles Lakers. He has been been praised for playing an inclusive brand of basketball, always involving his teammates, while playing high-level defense and contributing efficiently in many aspects in the game of basketball. His hardwork and ability to work with others has led him to win 3 NBA championships, 4 MVP awards, and 2 Olympic gold medals.

    One of the most signficant indicators of a player's success is their +/- rating, a statistic that measures the difference in one team's scoring and the opponent team's scoring while the player is in the game.
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
    The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict the +/- rating for Lebron's games based on several factors such as points scored, PER, rebounds, steals, blocks, and many more. There are two machine learning iterations, which include two rounds of feature engineering and testing machine learning models.

<p>
    The feature engineering includes cross-referencing features to create new numerical features while also comparing those numerical features to certain thresholds to create categorical features. The features are evaluated based off their correlation with the target (+/-) feature and the p-value from ANOVA tests and T-Tests.
